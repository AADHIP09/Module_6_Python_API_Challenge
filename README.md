**PART1: WEATHER PY**

In this deliverable, we will create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. Using the citipy Python libraryLinks to an external site., the OpenWeatherMap APILinks to an external site., and problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.

**The below visuals were generated:**

1) Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude: 
>Latitude vs. Temperature

>Latitude vs. Humidity

>Latitude vs. Cloudiness

>Latitude vs. Wind Speed

2) Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship:

>Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude - The r-value is -0.68, which indicates a negative relationship between Latitude and Temperature in the Northern Hemisphere. This means that the maximum temperature increases as the latitude decreases.

>Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude - The r-value is 0.83, which indicates a positive relationship between Latitude and Temperature in the Southern Hemisphere. This means that the maximum temperature increases with an increase in latitude.

>Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude - The r-value is -0.03, which indicates a neutral relationship between Latitude and Humidity in the Northern Hemisphere. This means that there is no correlation between the two.

>Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude - The r-value is -0.09, which indicates a neutral relationship between Latitude and Humidity in the Southern Hemisphere. This means that there is no correlation between the two.

>Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude - The r-value is -0.05, which indicates a neutral relationship between Cloudiness and Humidity in the Northern Hemisphere. This means that there is no correlation between the two.

>Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude - The r-value is -0.28, which indicates a neutral relationship between Latitude and Cloudiness in the Southern Hemisphere. This means that there is no correlation between the two.

>Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude - The r-value is -0.12, which indicates a neutral relationship between Latitude and Wind Speed in the Northern Hemisphere. This means that there is no correlation between the two.

>Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude - The r-value is -0.16 , which indicates a neutral relationship between Latitude and Wind Speed in the Southern Hemisphere. This means that there is no correlation between the two.







**PART 2: VACATION PY** 
In this deliverable, we will use Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API.


**The below visuals were generated:**

1) A map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame as shown in the following image. The size of the point on the map is indicative of the Humidity level in the particular city. 

2) Another map that displays the first hotel within 10000 meters of the coordinates in each city.
